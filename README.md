> This is a simple tool to perform url pattern shenanigans. 


## Install

```shell
go install github.com/floholz/imgut@latest
```

## Usage

To download images matching an url pattern, use the `download` command.

```shell
imgut download "https://flagsapi.com/B{A-F}/flat/64.png"
```

To only check if a matching url is valid, use the `fuzz` command.

```shell
imgut fuzz "https://flagsapi.com/B{A-F}/flat/64.png"
```

See the full documentation with the `help` command or at [doc.md](doc.md).

```shell
imgut help
```
